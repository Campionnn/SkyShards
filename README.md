## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access skyshards.com? Try These Steps:

If you're seeing a 404 error or the site won't load:

**Quick Fixes (try first):**

1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Try incognito/private mode** in your browser
3. **Wait 10-15 minutes** and try again
4. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Still not working? Clear DNS cache:**

**Windows:**

```bash
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**Mac:**

```bash
# Open Terminal:
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache && sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

**Check DNS (for troubleshooting):**

```bash
# Windows users - run these in Command Prompt:
nslookup skyshards.com
nslookup skyshards.com 8.8.8.8
ipconfig /displaydns | findstr skyshards

# Mac/Linux users:
nslookup skyshards.com
dig skyshards.com
```

**Router Reset:**

- Unplug your router for 30 seconds, then plug back in
- Or restart your internet connection

**Alternative Access:**

- **Direct Cloudflare URL**: https://skyshards-1jk.pages.dev
- **Status Page**: https://skyshards.com/status.html (or https://skyshards-1jk.pages.dev/status.html)
- Try using mobile data instead of WiFi
- Ask someone on a different network to test
- Use a VPN to test from a different location

If none of these work, the issue should resolve automatically within 24-48 hours as DNS propagates globally.
