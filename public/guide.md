# SkyShards Guide

Welcome to the **SkyShards Fusion Calculator**! This guide will help you use all the features of this tool to optimize your Skyblock shard fusions.

## Getting Started

The SkyShards calculator helps you determine the most efficient way to fuse your shards to achieve your desired shard.

### Navigation
- **[Calculator](https://skyshards.com)**: The main fusion calculator where you input your current shards and desired outcomes
- **[Shards](https://skyshards.com/shards)**: View and manage shard settings and configurations
- **[Recipes](https://skyshards.com/recipes)**: Browse all available fusion recipes and combinations
- **[Guide](https://skyshards.com/guide)**: This help page (you're here!)

## Basic Usage of the Calculator

### Step 1: Input Your Current Shards
1. Navigate to the [main calculator page](https://skyshards.com)
2. Enter the level of each of the listed shards and other configuration options
    - All the shards listed (plus Megalith) will help make shard grinding faster
    - You should try to prioritize getting these 10 shards to level 10 before doing bigger fusions
3. The calculator will automatically save your inputs if you turn on the "Auto Save" toggle at the top

### Step 2: Set Your Desired Shard
1. Specify which shards you want to end up with
2. The calculator will show you the optimal fusion path

### Step 3: Follow the Fusion Tree
The calculator will show you:
- **Fusion Tree**: Step-by-step instructions for how to fuse for the desired shard
- **Total Shards Needed**: How many of each shard you need to fuse the shard
- Direct shards are ones that you need to hunt

## Advanced Features

### Settings and Customization
Access the [Shards page](https://skyshards.com/shards) to:
- Customize shard rates
- The default for all the rates are with hyper-max gear and farming in the most optimal way possible (which usually means not solo)
- Adjust these shard rates for how quickly you can farm shards
- The calculator will automatically adjust the fusion tree based on your settings
- Rates are in shards per hour before applying any fortune multipliers

### Alternatives
On the very right of every recipe, there is a cogwheel icon
- Click it to see alternative fusion options
- This will show you different ways to achieve the same shard using different combinations of shards
- This is useful if you want to see if there are other ways to get a shard that may be faster for you or less annoying to grind

### Recipe Browser
Use the recipes page to:
- Explore all available fusion combinations
- Not very useful for planning fusions but can help you see how shards can be used or fused
