# SkyShards Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Issues Identified:

1. **Large Bundle Size**: 362KB JavaScript bundle (107KB gzipped)
2. **Expensive Re-renders**: Multiple components re-rendering on every state change
3. **Heavy CSS**: Complex backdrop-blur and glass-morphism effects
4. **Memory Usage**: Large dataset filtering in SettingsPage
5. **Animation Overhead**: Many CSS transitions and hover effects

## Optimization Strategy:

### 1. Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization

- Split routes into separate chunks
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize data loading

### 2. React Performance

- Memoize components and expensive calculations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- Debounce search and filtering

### 3. CSS Performance

- Reduce backdrop-blur usage
- Optimize hover transitions
- Use CSS containment for better paint performance

### 4. Data Optimization

- Virtualize large lists
- Implement efficient filtering
- Optimize data structures

### 5. Hardware Acceleration Fallbacks

- Detect and disable expensive effects when hardware acceleration is unavailable
- Provide performance mode toggle
